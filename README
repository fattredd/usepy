# Useful Funcs #
################
This is a compelation of scripts that I've written/collected
that I've used more than once. Some are just for fun, some
are just plain useful.

Please note that I didn't write all of these scripts.
I mearly assembled them. If you have a problem with
your script being used/want credit, you can always
email me at fattredd@gmail.com

If you have anything to add, you can also email me,
or just send a pull request. Do whatcha gotta do.

randInts()
	prints a series of numbers between 0 and 9 using stdout.
	To stop, press Ctrl+C

spin()
	creates a spinning icon. Useful for indicating loading.
	Should be modified for any real use.

fonetic(pword):
	pword is a string. returns the phoneticly spelled out
	version of the string.

colors
	a dictionary containing some of the useful colors that
	stdout can utilize. These are all strings, so you can use
	them like this:
		sys.stdout.write(colors['red']+'This is red '+colors['black']\
			+'This is black')

showColors()
	This prints out all of the colors that stdout can use.
	It shows the effect, as well as the escape character to
	use it. See colors for usage of these strings.

opt() - by mrtransisteur
	A one time pad. text is a string that will be en/decrypted.
	key is a list of integers. encrypting is True if encoding,
	false if decoding
