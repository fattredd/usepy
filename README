# Useful Funcs #
################
This is a compelation of scripts that I've written/collected
that I've used more than once. Some are just for fun, some
are just plain useful.

Please note that I didn't write all of these scripts.
I mearly assembled them. If you have a problem with
your script being used/want credit, you can always
email me at fattredd@gmail.com

If you have anything to add, you can also email me,
or just send a pull request. Do whatcha gotta do.
